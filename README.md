## Torn - Post Retrieval Tool
A tool used to retrieve forum threads and post data from Torn.com. Uses VADER to perform sentiment analysis on each post and rate them.

The resulting data was used to create a Tableau Public dashboard and  which can be found here (the title is a parody).

**[State Ov The Forums](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/komir3512/viz/StateOvTheForum-2024/StateOvForums?publish=yes)**

Unfortunately, it's not very mobile friendly.

It contains several pages of general analysis and some pages with filters allowing players to select themselves (or friends) to see their own data.  Tableau Public was very limiting (but also free) so several of the button and filter layouts cannot be changed much.

Enjoy!
